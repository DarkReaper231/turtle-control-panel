A control panel that let's you monitor and control your [ComputerCraft](https://www.computercraft.info/) turtles through a websocket connection.

The turtles will show up on the dashboard where their online state, activities and fuel consumption can be monitored.

Clicking on one of the turtles brings you to the turtle control panel where you can monitor a single turtle more closely as well as change it's behaviour and activities or watch it move around on the minimap.

The map only shows you what the turtle can see (or have seen) and may not be a realistic interpretation of the world as it may have changed since the last time the turtle inspected the block.
